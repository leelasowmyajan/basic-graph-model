# Testing the Model

The model built so far should answer the following use cases:

- **Use case #1** - Who borrowed *1984*?
- **Use case #2** - Who lent the books to David Wilson?
- **Use case #3** - What books have been borrowed by Emily Clark?
- **Use case #4** - Who wrote *Sense and Sensibility*?

By querying the model, we can verify that it satisfies these use cases.
